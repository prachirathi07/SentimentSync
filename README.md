# 📨 WhatsApp Chat Analyzer WebApp
📖 Overview
The WhatsApp Chat Analyzer WebApp is a powerful tool designed to process and analyze WhatsApp chat histories using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Leveraging BERT and other advanced language models, this web application provides deep insights into chat data by generating sentiment analysis, word usage trends, emoji analysis, and more. This tool is ideal for those looking to understand group dynamics, emotional trends, and language patterns in chat conversations.
## 💡 Problem Statement
WhatsApp chats, often filled with informal and colloquial language, are difficult to analyze using traditional NLP methods. This project addresses the need for an automated solution capable of processing such chat data and generating insightful, real-time visual reports that capture emotional shifts and group behavior.

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 LLM-Based Sentiment Analysis: Uses fine-tuned BERT to improve accuracy by 20% when analyzing informal and colloquial texts.
- 📈 Chat History Insights: Extracts key insights like sentiment trends, word usage, and user engagement from large chat histories.
- 📊 Dynamic Visual Reports: Generates visual reports such as word clouds, emoji analysis, and sentiment heatmaps to illustrate group dynamics and emotional shifts over time.
- 🚀 Scalable Pipelines: Efficiently processes extensive chat data with scalable pipelines, making it suitable for large groups or long chat histories.
